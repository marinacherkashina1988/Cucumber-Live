class 1 live:

create maven project
give name to group id (org.syntax or your company name) and artifact id (Project name)

cucumber starts from:

first, we write test case / scenario
second, generate step definitions

rules to remember:
every step definition should be unique
after generating step def, we cannot add anything in feature file
we can reuse all the steps in feauture file but we cannot add step deef in every class

background:

till the time flow is same in all the common steps for the scenario in one feature file

hooks:

rule: there aare only 2 tags whoich are @before (precondition )and @after (postcondition)
it alwaysd will be available in steps package

execution:
hooks - background - scenario
